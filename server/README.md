## Usage

### Start the Development Server
```Bash
npm start

When starting the server there are a couple of parameters you can pass:

* release - Enable release mode, which will generally disable debugging features

Hot reloading is in place, so you do not need to restart the server on file change.

#### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are supported:
* PORT - defaults to 1234 if not set

### Deployment
If you want to deploy your application, simply copy the dist folder and invoke
```Bash
